## Tech

I have used the following libraries for this script:

- `PyTorch` - Open Source Machine Learning framework!
- `NLTK` - built for working with NLP
- `DistilBERT` - masked language modelling mostly used for text and speach
- `Reddit API` - set of APIs that got rate limited to hell..
- `PRAW` - package that allows access to Reddit's API.
- `Transformers` - provides thousands of pretrained models
- `Pandas` - duh
- `Hub` - best Machine Learning and AI Community  
- `Github Actions` - env to execute pretty much everything using .yaml

## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. 
Today, companies have large volumes of text data like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media comments, and reviews.
Sentiment analysis tools can scan this text to automatically determine the authorâ€™s attitude towards a topic. Companies use the insights from sentiment analysis to improve customer service and increase brand reputation.
